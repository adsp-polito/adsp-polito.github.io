## Applied Data Science Project (ADSP 01TXXSM)

### 2024-2025 1st Semester

The course is offered in the first semester of the 2nd year at Politecnico di Torino, Data Science and Engineering. The course is in English. 

The main objective of the course is to carry on the development of an artificial intelligence solution utilizing a data science approach. The topics of the course range from the design, development and management aspects to the communication of the project leading to the finalization of the solution.
The goal of this course is to let students face, for the first time, a long running project and learn how to manage all project steps (problem specification, task assignment, design and implementation of the solution, testing, milestones management, writing of intermediate and final reports, result communication).
Laboratory activities will expose students with first-hand experience in projects that massively use data science methodologies in collaboration with companies and applied research institutes with an international breadth.
