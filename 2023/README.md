## Applied Data Science Project (ADSP 01TXXSM)

### 2023-2024 1st Semester

The course is offered in the first semester of the 2nd year.
The course is taught in English.

The main objective of the course is to learn how to develop an artificial intelligence solution utilizing a data science approach. The topics of the course range from the design, development and management aspects to the communication of the project leading to the finalization of the solution.

The goal of this course is to let students work on a long running project and learn how to manage all project steps (problem specification, task assignment, design and implementation of the solution, testing, milestones management, writing of intermediate and final reports, result communication).

Laboratory activities will expose students with first-hand experience with data science methodologies in collaboration with international companies and applied research institutes.
