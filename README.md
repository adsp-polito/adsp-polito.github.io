## Applied Data Science Project (01TXXXSM)

The course is offered in the first semester of the 2nd year at Politecnico di Torino, Data Science and Engineering. The course is in English. 

The course covers the main pillars of executing a successful data science project ranging from the computational and management aspects to the communication one.
The goal of this course is to let students face, for the first time, a long running project and learn how to manage all project steps (problem specification, task assignment, design and implementation of the solution, testing, milestones management, writing of intermediate and final reports, result communication).
Laboratory activities will expose students with first-hand experience in projects that use massively data science methodologies in collaboration with companies and applied research institutes with an international breadth.
